# Shoot-em-Up
The first project of the "Indie Workshop" course - André Young. This game was created using the learnings from the course and with simple instructions from André Young.

This game is called "navinha the game" and it is based on killing enemies until reaching 400 points, after that, surviving 60 seconds and, finally, beating the final boss.
Despite the short type of mechanics, the difficulty is what makes "navinha" fun and challenging.

By far, most of the time you play "navinha" you will be at a simple and famous mechanic, where randomly enemies will be spawned from the top of the screen.
**There are 3 different enemies, like:**

- melee - The easiest one to kill, it doesn't have any gun despite its own spaceship. It has a zig-zag movement to make it harder to hit with shots and high damage if it hits you!!
- shoot - The hardest to kill, it fires a double laser which forces the player to be fast, firing at the enemy and rapidly getting out of the way.
- multishoot - Not the hardest and not the easiest, but it may be the biggest responsible for your death. It has 4 guns distributed at 90-degree angles which all 4 guns fire at the same time. Furthermore, its spaceship still rotates 360 degrees, so if you don't kill it when you have the opportunity, you'll probably be hit by a shoot.

However, to help you defeat these enemies, power-ups and hp have a chance of being dropped after killing any enemy. **There are 5 power-up:**

- multishot
- minigun
- bomb
- shield
- move speed

If you reached 400 points and survived 60 seconds, congratulations, now you will fight the final boss.

#### About the boss:

The boss has 3 stages:

- simple shoot - The boss uses its 2 simple guns, which fire alternatively.
- minigun - The boss uses its other 2 guns, which fire pretty fast and with a random pattern.
- laser - The boss uses its other 4 guns, which activate 4 vertical lasers.

## Talking a little about the main scripts

- EntityStats - It's the responsible for the stats of all enemies, player e boss.
- FinalBossScript - Controls the mechanics of the final boss
- SpawnManager - Controls the spawn of the enemies.
- PlayerScript - Responsible for the mechanics of the player.
